#Call Center Trend Analysis

I joined a virtual internship of PwC through Forage, where my role was of Power BI Analyst. This is the 1st BI task from the internship, objective was to analyse the trends & patterns of a call center through the data provided.
My first approach was to check the data & perform data cleaning for better results & started my analysis on Power BI Desktop.
